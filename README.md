## ‚ú® Features

*   **Multi-Modal Analysis**: Combines three distinct data sources for robust predictions.
    *   **Technical Analysis**: Utilizes LSTM neural networks on historical price data and indicators (RSI, MACD, Moving Averages, Bollinger Bands).
    *   **Sentiment Analysis**: Employs a pre-trained `distilbert` model from Hugging Face to analyze news headlines for market sentiment.
    *   **Fundamental Analysis**: Incorporates key valuation metrics like P/E Ratio, P/B Ratio, and Market Cap.
*   **Fusion AI Model**: A `RandomForestClassifier` that intelligently weights the predictions from each modality (Technical, Sentiment, Fundamental) to generate a final bull/bear probability.
*   **Interactive Dashboard**: A beautiful, responsive Streamlit web app with interactive Plotly charts for visual analysis.
*   **Real-time Data**: Fetches live stock data from Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`).
*   **News Integration**: Can pull real news headlines using the NewsAPI (with a provided key) or uses a realistic simulator for demonstration.
